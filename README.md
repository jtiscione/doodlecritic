# Doodle Critic
#### GET IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK ON YOUR ART.

Draw in the canvas, and a neural network will guess what you're drawing!

It has been trained using [The Quick, Draw! Dataset](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com) from Google,
a downloadable database of 50 million doodles separated into 343 categories.

Try to be patient with its poor vision! My neural network is only 70% as accurate as the one at Google.
They have a server farm, and I have an RTX 2060 card with 6 GB.

You will have to draw carefully for it. Keep in mind that it has only seen doodles people have drawn
in 20 seconds or less, and most people can't draw. As soon as Google recognizes a doodle, they
snatch the canvas away from the artist and move on to the next. Therefore your doodle should look like
it took less than 20 seconds to draw.

Some of the more annoying characteristics of neural networks are on display here. A few categories are
easy to draw because they've become synonyms for "I don't know". Other categories are
almost impossible. With many of them I have no clue what this thing is looking for.

Google uses a recurrent neural network that notices the speed and timing of your strokes as you draw.
This is a convolutional neural network with a conventional, vanilla design; it just looks at the image.
If you think you can do better, feel free to fork this project on [Github](http://gethub.com/jtiscione/doodlecritic)
and swap out this network's simple model structure with your own. The training script is written in
Python using the Pytorch library. You will need to download about 20 GB of data from Google if you want to
train your own network.

# PROJECT DETAILS

### JAVASCRIPT STUFF

This is a Node.js based app, using Express and React to provide an interface to a
pretrained network. The network definition is loaded in ONNX format by the server on startup; it is a
300 MB file called `cnn_model.onnx` and is too big to check into the repository.

If you start the server without `cnn_model.onnx` present, it will download a copy from a bucket I left on S3.
A much smaller file (`labels.txt`) will also be downloaded from S3 if it is not present. In general these two
files are a matched set and are generated by the Python training script.





This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
